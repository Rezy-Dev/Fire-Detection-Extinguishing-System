# Fire Detection & Extinguishing System by Team Jenetri

## Overview

This collaborative project is led by Team Jenetri and aims to develop a Fire Detection & Extinguishing System using Arduino Uno, Fire Sensor, Buzzer, Relay Module, Mini Water Pump, Jumping Wires, and a Battery/Adapter. Combining Robotics and IoT principles, the system provides an automated solution for fire detection and extinguishing.

## Project Components

-   **Arduino Uno:** Central microcontroller.
-   **Fire Sensor:** Detects fire or high temperature.
-   **Buzzer:** Provides an audible alarm on fire detection.
-   **Relay Module:** Controls the Mini Water Pump.
-   **Mini Water Pump:** Dispenses water for fire extinguishing.
-   **Jumping Wires:** Connects various components.
-   **Battery/Adapter:** Power source for Arduino Uno and other components.

## Getting Started

To replicate or contribute:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    `git clone https://github.com/Rezy-Dev/Fire-Detection-Extinguishing-System.git` 
3.  **Upload Code to Arduino Uno:**
    
    -   Open Arduino IDE.
    -   Connect Arduino Uno to your computer.
    -   Open the Arduino code and upload it.
4.  **Assemble the Circuit:**
    
    -   Refer to the circuit diagram for correct assembly.
5.  **Power On:**
    
    -   Connect the power source to Arduino Uno.
6.  **Test the System:**
    
    -   Simulate fire or heat near the Fire Sensor.
    -   Observe the system's response â€“ the buzzer should sound, and the water pump should activate.
